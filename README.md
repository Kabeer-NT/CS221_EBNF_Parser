# CS221_EBNF_Parser
As part of my C and Systems Programming Coursework I built a parser that uses the Extended Backusâ€“Naur form formatting to read and parse numbers and symbols. Using this technique I built my own calculators. As of now it only has basic functionalities such as arthitemetic operators, logical operators and boolean operators. However it can be extended to suit your needs with little to no effort.
